🌸 Iris Flower Classification - Machine Learning Project
This project is a beginner-friendly introduction to Machine Learning using the famous Iris dataset. The goal is to build a simple model that can classify iris flowers into three species based on their physical characteristics.

📌 Project Description
The Iris dataset contains 150 samples of iris flowers, each described by four features:

Sepal Length

Sepal Width

Petal Length

Petal Width

Each sample is labeled with the correct species:

Setosa

Versicolor

Virginica

In this project, we:

Explored and visualized the dataset

Preprocessed the data to prepare it for training

Used the K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) algorithm to train the model

Evaluated the model's performance using accuracy and confusion matrix

Made predictions on new, unseen data

🔧 Technologies Used
Python 🐍

NumPy

Pandas

Matplotlib & Seaborn (for data visualization)

Scikit-learn (for ML algorithms)

🎯 Goal
The goal of this project is to:

Understand the basic workflow of a Machine Learning project

Practice data exploration, preprocessing, and model training

Learn how to evaluate a classification model
